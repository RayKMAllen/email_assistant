## Overview

The Email Assistant is a sophisticated conversational agent that understands natural language and proactively guides users through email processing workflows. This document explains the technical decisions, architecture, and implementation details.

## Conversational Architecture

The Email Assistant is built as a sophisticated conversational agent that understands natural language and proactively guides users through email processing workflows. The architecture features:

- Natural language understanding with intent classification
- Proactive conversation flow with state management
- Context-aware responses with automatic workflow progression
- Intelligent error recovery and user guidance

## Core Technical Components

### 1. Hybrid Intent Classification System

**Design Decision:** Combine rule-based patterns with LLM-based classification for optimal performance and reliability.

**Implementation:**
- **Rule-based Classification**: Fast pattern matching for common, clear intents
  - Uses regex patterns and keyword matching
  - High confidence for unambiguous inputs
  - Zero latency and no additional LLM costs
  
- **LLM-based Classification**: Intelligent analysis for complex or ambiguous inputs
  - Leverages Claude's natural language understanding
  - Context-aware classification considering conversation history
  - Handles creative phrasings and implied meanings

**Technical Benefits:**
- **Performance**: Rule-based matching provides instant responses for 70%+ of inputs
- **Intelligence**: LLM classification handles edge cases and complex language
- **Cost Efficiency**: Minimizes LLM API calls while maintaining high accuracy
- **Reliability**: Fallback mechanisms ensure robust operation

### 2. Conversation State Management

**Design Decision:** Implement a finite state machine to track conversation flow and maintain context.

**State Architecture:**
```python
GREETING → EMAIL_LOADED → INFO_EXTRACTED → DRAFT_CREATED → 
DRAFT_REFINED → READY_TO_SAVE → CONVERSATION_COMPLETE
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- **State Transitions**: Validated transitions based on successful operations
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains email content, extracted information, and draft history
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic transition to error recovery state with graceful handling
- **Multi-Email Support**: Context reset capabilities for processing multiple emails

**Benefits:**
- **Workflow Guidance**: Proactive suggestions based on current state
- **Context Awareness**: Responses tailored to conversation progress
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful recovery from failures
- **User Experience**: Seamless flow without manual state management

### 3. Natural Language Response Generation

**Design Decision:** Template-based response generation with dynamic content insertion and proactive guidance.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Response Templates**: Pre-defined templates for different intents and states
- **Dynamic Content**: Context-aware content insertion (email details, draft content, etc.)
- **Proactive Guidance**: State-based suggestions for next steps
- **Variability**: Multiple template variations to avoid repetitive responses

**Technical Features:**
- **Context Integration**: Responses include relevant email information
- **Tone Adaptation**: Response style matches conversation context
- **Error Messaging**: User-friendly error explanations with guidance
- **Workflow Progression**: Automatic suggestions for next logical steps

### 4. Enhanced LLM Integration

**Reasoning for AWS Bedrock and Claude 3.7 Sonnet:**
- **AWS Bedrock**: Provides managed LLM access with enterprise-grade security and reliability
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**: Excellent performance on conversational tasks and email communication
- **Cost Optimization**: Balanced performance vs. cost for email processing tasks
- **Scalability**: AWS infrastructure supports varying workloads

**Parameter Optimization for Conversational Use:**
```python
# Intent Classification (High Precision)
INTENT_CLASSIFICATION_TEMPERATURE = 0.2
INTENT_CLASSIFICATION_TOP_P = 0.1

# Email Processing (Balanced)
EMAIL_PROCESSING_TEMPERATURE = 0.3
EMAIL_PROCESSING_TOP_P = 0.2

# Conversational Responses (Natural)
RESPONSE_TEMPERATURE = 0.5
RESPONSE_TOP_P = 0.4
```

## Conversational Flow Implementation

### Natural Language Understanding Pipeline

1. **Input Processing**: Raw user input received
2. **Intent Classification**: Hybrid approach determines user intent
3. **Parameter Extraction**: Relevant information extracted from input
4. **Context Integration**: Current conversation state and history considered
5. **Validation**: Intent validity checked against current state
6. **Operation Execution**: Appropriate action performed
7. **State Transition**: Conversation state updated based on success
8. **Response Generation**: Natural language response with proactive guidance

### Context Maintenance Strategy

**Conversation Context:**
- **Email Content**: Original email text and metadata
- **Extracted Information**: Structured data from email analysis
- **Draft History**: All draft versions for iterative refinement
- **User Preferences**: Learned preferences for tone and style
- **Conversation History**: Full dialogue for context-aware responses

**Memory Management:**
- **Session-based**: Context maintained during active session
- **Selective Retention**: Key information preserved, verbose history summarized
- **Reset Capabilities**: Clean slate for new email processing workflows

### Proactive Guidance System

**State-Based Suggestions:**
- **EMAIL_LOADED**: "Would you like me to extract key information and draft a reply?"
- **INFO_EXTRACTED**: "Shall I draft a reply? I can adjust the tone as needed."
- **DRAFT_CREATED**: "How does this look? I can refine it or save it for you."

**Adaptive Guidance:**
- **User Behavior Learning**: Adapts suggestions based on user patterns
- **Context Sensitivity**: Guidance varies based on email content and complexity
- **Error Recovery**: Specific guidance when operations fail

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Graceful Error Recovery

**Error Classification:**
- **Intent Classification Failures**: Ambiguous input requiring clarification
- **Operation Errors**: Email processing or LLM API failures
- **State Transition Errors**: Invalid workflow transitions
- **Unexpected Errors**: System-level failures

**Recovery Strategies:**
- **Clarification Requests**: Context-aware questions for ambiguous inputs
- **Alternative Approaches**: Suggest different methods when operations fail
- **State Recovery**: Automatic transition to error recovery state
- **User Guidance**: Clear explanations and next step suggestions

### Robustness Features

**Input Validation:**
- **Email Content Detection**: Automatic recognition of email-like content
- **File Path Validation**: Verification of file accessibility
- **Parameter Extraction**: Robust parsing of user instructions

**Fallback Mechanisms:**
- **Rule-based Fallback**: When LLM classification fails
